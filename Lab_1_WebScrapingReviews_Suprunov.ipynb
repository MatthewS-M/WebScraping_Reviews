Unfortunately we never received it. It said delivered but it never delivered so he could tatted them and they supposedly mailed it out again. Instead of saying it delivered in mailbox this time, it said it delivered to a person. Neither of us received it. He asked for his money back since we never got anything and they said no.

They sent me a tracking number that did not work. Told me that it was too bad that my order got lost, that I should contact some insurance company and ask for a refund. Insurance company was a dead end, so I put a stop on my credit card for the charge. They then became more sympathetic and tried to send me a replacement pair of socks which again I never received. I asked for a refund and they said they can't because of the credit card dispute.\",\"reviewRating\":{\"@type\":\"Rating\",\"bestRating\":\"5\",\"worstRating\":\"1\",\"ratingValue\":\"1\"},\"publisher\":{\"@id\":\"https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Organization/1\"},\"inLanguage\":\"en\"}]}\n",

I sent all 3 portrait photos of our dogs which printed remarkably well, especially on the white socks. The socks are mid-calf, but my husband scrunches them down anyway. He LOVED them!

Впоследствии были применены модели машинного обучения, как для сбалансированных данных, так и для дисбалансных. Для каждой модели была отображена ее точность (accuracy) и время выполнения. В результате данной практической работы мной были отточены навыки процессинга текста на естественных языках и некоторые моменты машинного обучения. Исходя из полученного датафрейма метрик производительности определения рейтинга отзыва лучше всех показала себя модель `RandomForest` с `accuracy = 0.94`."

        "**Вывод**: с помощью модели машинного обучения `RandomForestClassifier`, данные для которой были отвекторизованы с помощью `TF-IDF`, а классы их сбалансированы с помощью `SMOTE`, было произведено тестирование модели на новых отзывах. Оценки в основном либо твердо положительные, либо твердо отрицательные, что и было отображено при составлении матрицы ошибок (модель лучше себя показывает на оценках \"очень плохо\" или \"отлично\"). В результате предсказания *8 из 10 оценок были определены корректно*, что не может не радовать. Считаю, что в дальнейшем после некоторых поправок, доработки и усовершенствования модели машинного обучения она будет показывать себя еще лучше."
